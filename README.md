##  Password Locker

### Description
Sometimes people have more than 7 accounts but it becomes very difficult to have different passwords and remember them all at once. In this web App, we have tried to solve the problem by having a password Locker

### Behavior Driven Development
Users are required to create an account after which they can successfully log into the application. Upon successful login, they can:

- Create new credentials.
    Here users are required to provide an application name, their username for the account they have/wish to have on the said application and a password they use/would like to use for the said account. Users are also provided with the option of a generated password of which they are further allowed to select the length they desire for the password.
- Find credentials.
    Here, users can find credentials of a specific application by providing the application's name.
- Delete a credential.
    Here, users can delete credentials they don't need anymore.
- See all credentials.
    Here, the user is able to view all their saved credentials at once.
- Users can also delete an active account.
